## Current Status âœ…
- âœ… Bluetooth feature completely removed
- âœ… Simulation mode removed - now production ready
- âœ… TURN server support added for restrictive networks
- âœ… File transfer feature implemented with chunking
- âœ… All core production features working
- âœ… Documentation updated

## Production Features Implemented
1. **WebRTC Configuration**
   - Multiple STUN servers for NAT traversal
   - TURN servers for restrictive networks
   - Automatic BroadcastChannel fallback
   - Optimized ICE candidate pool

2. **File Transfer System**
   - Chunked file transmission (16KB chunks)
   - Progress tracking for uploads/downloads
   - Support for all file types
   - Automatic download handling

3. **Security & Encryption**
   - End-to-end encryption for messages
   - Secure file transfers
   - Web Crypto API integration

4. **Communication Features**
   - Group chats (public/private)
   - Voice messages
   - Image sharing
   - Resource sharing
   - Location sharing
   - SOS alerts

5. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Multi-language support
   - Map visualization
   - Battery monitoring
   - Connection status indicators
   - Responsive design

## Notes
- ESLint configuration has circular dependency issue but doesn't affect functionality
- Application is production-ready for deployment
- Future enhancements can be added incrementally
